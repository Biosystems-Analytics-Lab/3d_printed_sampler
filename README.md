# 3D Printed Water Sampler

This repository includes materials for 3D printing a swinging water sample bottle holder. The sampler attachment holds a 1L sample bottle using a cable tie. The attachment screws on a standard telescoping pole (e.g., a paint roller pole). The sampler pivots such that the sample bottle can be easily filled with water. For each assembly, two washers, one bolt, and one nut with the following specs are required (all stainless steel):

- Bolts: ¼”-20 x 2-½”
- Nuts: ¼”-20
- Fender washers: ¼” x 1”

The `hardware.pdf` file includes images for the nuts, bolts, and washers we used to assemble the swing sampler.  

Be careful not to overtighten the threaded portion of the assembly onto a paint pole or other attachment. It may split the threaded body in half.

The design was created by Adam Rok and Jay Campbell in the Biological and Agricultural Engineering Department at NC State University in 2022. The designs were first published online on 26 Aug 2022.
