# 3D Printed Water Sampler

This repository includes materials for 3D printing a swinging water sample bottle holder. The sampler attachment holds a 1L sample bottle using a cable tie. The attachment screws on a standard telescoping pole (e.g., a paint roller pole). The sampler pivots such that the sample bottle can be easily filled with water. 

The design was created by Adam Rok and Jay Campbell in the Biological and Agricultural Engineering Department at NC State University in 2022. The designs were first published online on 26 Aug 2022.
